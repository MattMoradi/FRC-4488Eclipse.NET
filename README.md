# Shockwave Eclipse.NET
Shockwave Eclipse FRC Bot Programmed In C# Using WPILib.NET

This is a C# project I did over the summer programming the systems on the Shockwave FRC Eclipse Robot using WPILib.NET. 
Please note that the NuGet packages for the version of WPILib.NET in this project are outdated.
